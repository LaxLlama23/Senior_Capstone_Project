					**Alpha Release Questions**  
					  
**What do you hope to learn during this exercise?**  
Through this exercise I hope to learn more about AI and what roles it will play in the future. By  the end of the capstone experience I hope to learn how to form and write a research paper. 

**What skills will you have shown to an employer?**   
The skills that I will be able to show through my research paper is the ability to synthesize many different ideas into one cohesive form. Also that I have the ability to complete long and sometimes difficult projects under a deadline.  As well as show my creative abilities in the connections through my thoughts and ideas. 

**How much have you accomplished this far?**  
So far I have accomplished an outline of the overall structure of the paper. I have a rough scaffolding that I plan on building out each section one at a time until I have a complete paper. My goal is to add 10 more pages by the end of this week. In the last three days I plan on proofreading, fix any needed citations, and format in IEEE with latex.

**Discuss some of the problems along the way and how you solved them**  
 One of the problems I had before working on my paper was how I was going to be able to manage all of my references. In many of the papers I have read there are 30 plus references and I thought it was going to be a hassle to keep them organized, especially as I make changes to my paper. But as it turns out it was fairly easy to outrageous them and keep them updated in the correct order and edit my paper. This was done by using a program called zotero, It is a reference manager that stores the PDFs of the references. It also allows users to highlight and comment inside of the pdf. There is also the option to add notes next to the pdf. This program is integrated to the web as a chrome extension, where sources can be saved from the web to the program. It is also integrated with Google docs, being able to add and automatically change the order of the references. 

**Think about how to engage the audience in conversation**  
One way that I might do this is by posting some interesting hypotheticals about AI. Also I want to better convey the importance of this paper. I also want to invite questions into my project.
